BarCamp is a participatory “un-conference” event, where the attendees are in 
charge of what happens. We provide all the basic needs, and hope that people 
interested in teaching and learning in an open environment come together to 
share their knowledge and experience. 

What will the sessions be about at 
BarCampMilwaukee7? Whatever people are interested in. In past years, we’ve 
learned about robots, Drupal, Elevator Hacking, Ruby on Rails, video editing, 
technology solutions for non-profits, gone on PhotoWalks, discussed 
Microformats, talked about gadgets, played Nintendo Wii, Guitar Hero, werewolf, 
seen immersive 3D environments, talked about software development, open source, 
closed source, web development, geeks and sex… and plenty of other things. 
(Whew!)
