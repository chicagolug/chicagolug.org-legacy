We meet at [The Skiff](http://theskiff.org), a coworking space located at 6 Gloucester Street, Brighton - you can't miss the big glass front.

The idea of The Skiff is to take the best elements of a coffee shop (social, energetic, creative) and the best elements of a workspace (productive, functional) and combine them to give independent workers the chance to have their own, affordable space.

The Skiff also holds various events and are happy to consider making the facilities available for event hosting.
