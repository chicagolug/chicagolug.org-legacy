    <h2>GNU/Linux + Free/Libre & Open Source Software + Fun</h2>
    <p>We are a group of technology and Free software enthusiasts who live in 
    and around Chicago, IL. While our group primarily focuses on GNU/Linux, our 
    members have a broad range of interests and experience, and our ranks 
    include users of all major (and less major) operating systems.</p>
    
    <h2>Special Announcement</h2>
    <p>
      With the help of the Free Software Foundation, former Chicagoan Chris 
      Webber recently announced <a href="
      http://mediagoblin.org/pages/campaign.html">a fundraising compaign</a> 
      to support work on <a href="http://mediagoblin.org">GNU MediaGoblin</a>, 
      a Free software media-hosting platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the campaign is ending on Friday! If you can spare a few dollars, 
      please consider giving a donation to 
      this great, locally-grown Free software project. Even if you can't 
      spare a few bucks, though, have a look at the <a href="
      http://mediagoblin.org/news/crowdfunding-campaign-launches.html">website 
      and video</a> to learn more about what Chris and the team are doing to 
      support Free and Open Source software on the web. <a href="http://mediagoblin.org/news/very-busy-goblins.html">
      This video</a> explains things even more! Thanks!
    </p>
