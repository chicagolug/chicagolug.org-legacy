Our next meeting is set for Saturday, March 23rd, starting at 12:00pm. Joel Luellwitz will be presenting on Linux
utilities, technologies and best practices with regards to authentication and security. Part of his focus will be on
what can go wrong if these tools are used improperly.

We still have room for one presenter, so feel free to speak up if there's something you would like to talk about, or if
there's something you'd like to learn more about.

People of all ability levels are welcome to join us, learn more GNU/Linux, 
and contribute. If you have any questions, feel free to be in touch via our
mailing list or any of our social media channels.
