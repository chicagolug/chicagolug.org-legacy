Let's join our friends at Free Geek Chicago to participate in their weekly 
Open Hack Nights. This is a standing, weekly gathering, and people will 
typically join as their schedule allows.

This event is held at the [Free Geek Chicago](http://freegeekchicago.org) world 
headquarters, located at 3411 West Diversey Avenue in Chicago.
