Let's join our friends at Free Geek Chicago to participate in their weekly 
*Open Hack Night.* This is a standing, weekly gathering, and people will 
typically join as their schedule allows. It's also a woman- and LGBTQ-friendly 
event, and is open to people of all ability levels. People who participate 
should follow the Free Geek [Code of Conduct](http://ur1.ca/ar7dg). 

Free Geek's *Open Hack Night* is held at the [Free Geek Chicago](http://freegeekchicago.org) 
world headquarters, located at 3411 West Diversey Avenue in Chicago.
