Our next meeting is set for Saturday, January 19th, starting at 12:00pm.
Meg Ford will be reporting on the outcomes from the recent GNOME developer tools
hackfest that in Belgium. There was a lot of discussion at the hackfest around
GObject bindings, dynamic vs. statically typed languages, and debugging large
applications written in dynamic languages.

Following-up on Chris Webber's recent talk on Emacs, we'll also include time for lightning talks on how we're using Emacs (or our personal editor of choice). Show up ready to share a few tips.

The event will be at Chicago's Pumping Station: One, located at 
3519 North Elston in Chicago. Talks and speaking order are subject to change.

People of all ability levels are welcome to join us, learn more GNU/Linux, 
and contribute. If you have any questions, feel free to be in touch via our
mailing list or any of our social media channels.
