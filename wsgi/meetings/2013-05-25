We've scheduled our May meeting for `Saturday, May 25th`, starting at 12:00pm at 
[Pumping Station: One](http://chicagolug.org/locations/psone/). Early birds 
typically start showing up by about 11:40 or so. If
you're there early, just sit tight. If you show up late, please knock
loudly on the door so we can hear you from upstairs.

Speaking Topics
---------------

William Giokas is tentatively set to talk on [systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd), 
but we still have at least one open spot. Feel free to suggest a talk on the 
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/chicagolinux-discuss).

Hacking
-------

As per usual, several of us will use some of the meeting time to hack on
GNOME-related projects, but feel free to bring whatever project that you want
to work on.

If you need help with setting-up or fixing your computer, please let us know
in advance so that we can plan accordingly.

Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the [GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/),
but it's typically a good idea to bring a few dollars if you want to partake
of pizza and drinks.
