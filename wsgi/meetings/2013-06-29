We've scheduled our June meeting for `Saturday, June 29th`, starting at 12:00pm at 
[Pumping Station: One](http://chicagolug.org/locations/psone/). Early birds 
typically start showing up by about 11:40 or so. All are welcome.

Speaking Topics
---------------

Sten Turpin of Red Hat will be presenting on OpenShift, but we also have one
additional speaking slot open. Feel free to speak up if there's something you'd
like to talk on during this meeting.

Hacking
-------

As per usual, several of us will hack on GNOME-related projects, but feel free
to bring whatever project that you want to work on.

If you need help with setting-up or fixing your computer, please let us know
in advance so that we can plan accordingly.

Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the [GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/),
but it's typically a good idea to bring a few dollars if you want to partake
of pizza and drinks.
