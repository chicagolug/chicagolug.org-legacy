We've scheduled our June meeting for Saturday, July 20th, starting at 12:00pm at 
[Pumping Station: One](http://chicagolug.org/locations/psone/). Early birds 
typically start showing up by about 11:40 or so. All are welcome.

Speaking Topics
---------------

TBD (aka,  you should suggest something on the mailing list)  

Hacking
-------

As per usual, several of us will hack on GNOME-related projects, but feel free
to bring whatever project that you want to work on.

If you need help with setting-up or fixing your computer, please let us know
in advance so that we can plan accordingly.

Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the [GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/),
but it's typically a good idea to bring a few dollars if you want to partake
of pizza and drinks.
