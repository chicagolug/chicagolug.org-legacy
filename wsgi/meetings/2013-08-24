We've scheduled our August meeting for Saturday, August 24th, starting at
12:00pm at [Pumping Station: One](http://chicagolug.org/locations/psone/).
Early birds typically start showing up by about 11:40 or so. All are welcome.

Speaking Topics
---------------

Bonnie King of [Fermilab](https://www.fnal.gov/) will be giving a talk on
[Scientific Linux](https://www.scientificlinux.org/), a Linux distribution
built from publicly available open source SRPMS provided by "a prominent North
American Enterprise Linux vendor."  From the website, "Scientific Linux is a
Linux release put together by Fermilab, [CERN](http://home.web.cern.ch/), and
various other labs and universities around the world. Its primary purpose is to
reduce duplicated effort of the labs, and to have a common install base for the
various experimenters." 

Gregorie Thomas will also present on basic linux server security.

Hacking
-------

As per usual, several of us will hack on GNOME-related projects, but feel free
to bring whatever project that you want to work on.

If you need help with setting-up or fixing your computer, please let us know
in advance so that we can plan accordingly.

Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the [GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/),
but it's typically a good idea to bring a few dollars if you want to partake
of pizza and drinks.
