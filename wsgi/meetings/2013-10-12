We've scheduled our October meeting for Saturday, October 12, starting at
2:30pm at [Pumping Station: One](http://chicagolug.org/locations/psone/).
All are welcome.

Speaking Topics
---------------

Freddy Martinez of
[Radicals Against Discrimination](https://twitter.com/ChicagoRADicals)
will be giving a talk on personal data security. Jim Campbell will be
following-up Freddy, leading a discussion around how we want to use new
cloud server resources that have been generously offered to us by a hosting
provider.

Hacking
-------

As per usual, several of us will also hack on GNOME-related projects, but feel
free to bring whatever project that you want to work on.

If you need help with setting-up or fixing your computer, please let us know
in advance so that we can plan accordingly.

Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the [GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/),
but it's typically a good idea to bring a few dollars if you want to partake
of pizza and drinks.
