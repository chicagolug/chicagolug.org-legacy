We've scheduled our November meeting for Saturday, November 16, starting at
2:30pm at [Pumping Station: One](http://chicagolug.org/locations/psone/).
All are welcome.

Speaking Topics
---------------

At the moment, our speaking topics are still TBD. Watch the mailing list or
social media outlets for an announcement regarding speakers and topics.

Or you could, you know, suggest a speaking topic. :) Maybe.

Hacking
-------

As per usual, several of us will also hack on GNOME-related projects, but feel
free to bring whatever project that you want to work on.

If you need help with setting-up or fixing your computer, please let us know
in advance so that we can plan accordingly.

Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the [GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/),
but it's typically a good idea to bring a few dollars if you want to partake
of pizza and drinks.
