Speaking Topics
---------------

Erik Johnson will be providing a demonstration of
[SaltStack](http://www.saltstack.com), a server orchestration and configuration
tool. As a demonstration of its features, he'll take us through how we can use
SaltStack on CentOS to configure and manage Ubuntu, OpenSUSE and FreeBSD
servers.

Erik is a Python Engineer with Salt Stack, and also organizes the Fox Valley
Linux User Group in Aurora.

Our second speaker is still TBD. Please do let us know if you're interested in
giving a talk this month.

Hacking
-------

As per usual, several of us will also hack on GNOME-related projects, but feel
free to bring whatever project that you want to work on.

If you need help with setting-up or fixing your computer, please let us know
in advance so that we can plan accordingly.

Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the [GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/),
but it's typically a good idea to bring a few dollars if you want to partake
of pizza and drinks.
